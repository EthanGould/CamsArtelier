				<p class="biography-content">
					Allen Mayo was born in 1989, in Memphis, TN. There he built lifelong relationships with friends and family until his departure to Alaska in 2009.  There he began working at a local sporting goods store specializing in hunting, fishing, camping and outerwear. As Allen works there, he continues to make new friends and acquire knowledge and stories from those around him.  Good friends and wonderful artists Kathleen and Gabe Brown inspired Allen to start painting in 2014. Understanding he was not where he wanted to be with a brush, Allen switched to using a palette knife with oil paints.  Allen's landscape paintings are inspired by the images provided by Anthony Madden Photography here in Anchorage.

					The Browns are great friends and were the primary driving force behind my pursuit of art.  Gabe&#39s ability to draw true-to-life portraits in sharp and detailed graphite pencil is aw-inspiring as well as paint originals like “Fishing” and Kat&#39s ability to continuously produce quality inspired pieces is incredible.  Gabe and Kat live in Eagle River, Ak by way of Augusta, GA.</p>

				<p class="biography-content">
					Anthony is one of Alaska&#39s most elite photographers. When it comes to capturing a one of a kind image, Anthony does it all by going above and beyond in temperatures well below zero to a preserved, secret location of his on his snow machine around Denali and occasionally sleeping in nothing but a sleeping bag overnight.  This is just an example of his dedication to bring too you the most beautiful, striking, and clear images possible of his countless untouched locations around the state of Alaska. Thanks to the photos of areas and locations unbeknownst to me provided by Anthony, I am able to use his shots as a template to create pieces of my own on canvas.</p>
