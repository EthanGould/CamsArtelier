			<h2>Art Appraisals</h2>
				<p class="appraisal-content">
					I will say that I am an artist and not an appraiser.  That does not mean I am not willing to look at anybody’s work.  I would like to explain appraisals a little bit. Doing much research there are not as many “certified appraisers” that exist as one would think.  An artist can look at a painting an normally tell if it is oil, acrylic or other medium and also an approximate amount of time it might have taken to paint it.  Also taking into consideration the size, the age, how intricate the painting is, and the notoriety of the artist all add up to an approximate cost.
				</p>
			<h2>BEWARE</h2>
				<p class="appraisal-content">
					It is recommended to take your art to a local auction house for appraisal.Be cautious when doing that as fine arts antiques dealers and of course appraisers who offer free pricing or appraisal services may really be looking into buying items they appraise on the cheap end of the spectrum, which is an obvious conflict of interest. In situations like this, when people bring them art they want, there's a temptation to appraise the piece artificially low, and then offer to buy at or below those values.
				</p>
			<h2>Art Advisory Panel</h2>
				<p class="appraisal-content">
					The Panel helps IRS review and evaluate property appraisals submitted by taxpayers in support of the fair market value claimed for works of art included in federal income, estate and gift tax cases in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code. The Panel members, up to 25 renowned art experts, serve without compensation.
				</p>
			<h2>Referral to the Art Advisory Panel</h2>
				<p class="appraisal-content">
					All taxpayer cases selected for examination that include an item of art with a claimed value of $50,000 or more must be referred to Art Appraisal Services for possible review by the Commissioner's Art Advisory Panel (See IRM 4.48.2 and IRM 8.18.1.3). Please review the photographic requirements for referrals, and also our preferred individual appraisal item format (PDF) for works of art valued at over $50,000.
